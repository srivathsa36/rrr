        RRR received universal praise for Rajamouli's direction, screenplay, performances, soundtrack, action sequences, and visuals. The film was considered one of the ten best films of the year by the National Board of Review, making it only the second non-English language film ever to make it to the list.[9] The song "Naatu Naatu" won the Best Original Song award at the 95th Academy Awards, making it the first song from an Indian film, as well as the first from an Asian film, to win in this category. This made the film[10][11] the first Indian film by an Indian production to win an Academy Award. The film became the third Indian film and first Telugu film to receive nominations at the Golden Globe Awards, including Best Foreign Language Film, and won Best Original Song for "Naatu Naatu", making it the first Indian (as well as the first Asian) nominee to win the award.[12][13] RRR also won the awards for Best Foreign Language Film and Best Song at the 28th Critics' Choice Awards.

However, Bheem himself divulges his tribal identity and his mission, unaware of Raju's true identity. At an event to honor Scott, Bheem's men barge into his residence with a lorry filled with wild animals, creating havoc among the guests. The animals maul Scott's guards, allowing Bheem to briefly gain the upper hand; however, Raju arrives and they fight briefly but Bheem is forced to give up when Scott threatens to kill Malli. Raju is promoted for thwarting Bheem, yet he is guilt-stricken over his actions, recalling his pro-nationalistic background and his alter-ego as a mole within the police; he sought a promotion to gain access to gun shipments to smuggle to his village to fulfill a promise made to his dying father Alluri Venkatarama Raju, a revolutionary

        To mark the mission's successful completion, Raju asks Bheem to make a wish he can grant; Bheem asks Raju to provide education for him and his community.
